### Project Summary

**Title: Stock Drawdown Analysis**

This project involves analyzing the drawdown of a specified stock over a given period. The drawdown is a measure of the peak-to-trough decline in the stock's price during that period. The project identifies the worst drawdown, the period during which it occurred, and visualizes the stock price alongside the drawdown period.

### Key Features:
- **Stock Data Retrieval:** Utilized the `yfinance` library to download historical adjusted close prices for the specified stock.
- **Drawdown Calculation:** Calculated the cumulative maximum of the stock price to identify drawdowns, and determined the worst drawdown during the specified period.
- **Period Analysis:** Identified the start and end dates of the worst drawdown and calculated the duration of this period.
- **Data Visualization:** Plotted the stock price over time, highlighting the drawdown period on the chart with vertical lines.

### Key Skills:
- **Programming:** Python (`yfinance`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`)
- **Data Analysis:** Drawdown calculation, cumulative maximum, period analysis
- **Financial Metrics:** Drawdown analysis, peak-to-trough measurement
- **Data Visualization:** Time series plotting, highlighting significant periods
